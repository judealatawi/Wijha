## Introduction
Wijha makes it easier to identify places based on your preferences and interests, saving you time in the process.

## Solution Concept
We‚Äôre all aware that new caf√©s and restaurant appear every day in Riyadh, but we don‚Äôt know about them or discover them. So we developed an idea to create a new application that helps you select destinations based on your likes and interests, saving you time in the process.

## Technologies & Tools üõ†Ô∏è

* ### CloudKit Notifications

* ### Localization
      The app is available in both Arabic and English.
